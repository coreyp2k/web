        <p><i>
            <strong>With over 15,000 sea days annually, A.I.S., Inc. has a proven track record of safely and successfully providing services for Offshore Wind Developers, Oil & Gas Exploration, and the Dredging and Construction industry.</strong> With offices in MA, NJ, WA, and Alaska and personnel located along the coastal communities in between we excel in  mobilizing and supporting mobilize and support a highly qualified and geographically dispersed workforce of professionals, our commitment to customer service, and our innovative management approaches.  We have an established portfolio in delivering high quality, performance based professional, scientific and technical services for the offshore industry from Maine to Florida, the Gulf of Mexico, the Gulf of Alaska and The Great Lakes. AIS works with industry leading technology partners, clients, and regulatory agencies to pioneer offshore wind development to extend their operations to include nighttime piling, as well as advancing real-time 24/7 land-based remote monitoring solutions to support these operations.
        </i></p>
        <h2>Project Management</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            Our project managers oversee and manage all field teams deployed on marine dredging and construction, offshore wind, and renewable energy projects that have environmental monitoring and mitigation requirements. Project management staff serve as primary technical liaisons between all project stakeholders including clients, regulators, subcontractors, and corporate partners.  They are responsible for understanding all relevant project related permitting and regulatory documents, and developing and administering environmental monitoring and mitigation plans to ensure field staff are fully understanding of all project requirements.  Additionally, project managers interview and manage field staff and review, analyze and technically report on data collected in the field.
        </p>
        <h2>Field Project Management</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            We employ Field Project Managers on projects requiring significant oversight and coordination of large teams of field staff.  Field project managers confirm protected species detections (both visual and acoustic), communicate with all project personnel in a professional manner, review data submitted by field staff teams, submit daily, weekly, monthly reports in required time frames, evaluate new mitigation tools and identify areas for improvement and perform field staff duties as needed.  They act as the primary point of contact with project operations management staff and A.I.S., Inc. Project Managers and advise operations teams on project specific regulatory requirements and real time mitigation actions required.
        </p>
        <h2>Client Representation</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            AIS provides Client Representatives to oversee operations, document survey equipment calibrations, provide daily summaries of survey activities, and ensure all HSE protocols are followed during offshore renewable industry operations.  Client Representative are responsible for understanding the project Scope of Work and Project Execution Plan to be able to accurately report back daily to Client and confirm that proper protocols are being followed and ensure that the data being collected is of highest quality and meets the core A.I.S., Inc. values of accuracy, integrity and service.   
        </p>
        <h2>Protected Species Observation</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            All Protected Species Observers (PSO) employed by A.I.S., Inc. have completed relevant Protected Species Observer trainings, are approved to work as PSOs by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) in the United States, are medically cleared for offshore deployments, and have completed an offshore safety training.  Our PSOs provide real-time monitoring and mitigation while working in close contact with the crew with the objective of optimizing operational activity while insuring and documenting regulatory compliance.  Lead PSOsâ€™ are assigned to lead the PSO team and act as the primary field contact for advisement on project specific regulatory requirements and real time mitigation actions as well as conducting QA/QC checks on all data collected by the PSO team prior to submission.
        </p>
        <h2>Vessel Strike Avoidance</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            A.I.S., Inc. provides vessel strike avoidance on projects requiring a dedicated watch for the presence of protected species during all vessel transits.  Like the Protected Species Observers, A.I.S., Inc. Vessel Strike Avoidance Observers (VSAO) have completed relevant Protected Species Observer trainings, are approved to work as PSOs by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) in the United States, are medically cleared for offshore deployments, and have completed an offshore safety training.   They record all detections of protected species and provide guidance to the vessel crew on any avoidance measures that need to be implemented to prevent interactions between nearby protected species and the vessel itself.

        </p>
        <h2>Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM)</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            Our Passive Acoustic Monitoring Operators monitor the presence of marine protected species using acoustic technology and call for mitigation measures to be implemented based on regulatory requirements.  In addition to monitoring and mitigation, PAM operators must be able to identify and troubleshoot any issues with the acoustic monitoring equipment being used which may include static or towed arrays.  Passive acoustic monitoring can be conducted both in the field and remotely depending on the technology selected for the project.
        </p>
        <h2>Fisheries Liaising</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            Our Fisheries Liaison Officers (FLO) are placed in permanent communication with fishing vessels and clients, using their local knowledge, expertise and experience in fishing operations to encourage cooperation and ensure operational efficiency and absence of incidents during the operations. The service they provide is essential where the fishing activity is high, reducing possible disturbances between the clientâ€™s and other fishing vessels. They also provide real-time assistance and advice to the survey crew with the objective of minimizing hindrance to fishing activities, avoid conflicts while ensuring high environmental standards. Data collection of environmental, protected species and operational conditions are an integral part of our FLOsâ€™ responsibility and commitment to accurate reporting
        </p>
        <h2>Avian Monitoring</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            A.I.S., Inc. has a dedicated team of avian monitors who are deployed on projects requiring monitoring for shorebird species to document their location, identify courtship/nesting behaviors and coordinate protection of their habitat as required by permit and regulatory requirements.  The Avian Monitors coordinate with A.I.S., Inc. project management staff and onsite operations teams to ensure that any identified protected avian species habitats are documented, avoided and protected to minimize impacts.
        </p>
        <h2>Training Experts</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            A.I.S., Inc. has a team of Training Specialists who are responsible for developing, maintaining, and delivering comprehensive trainings for field staff deploying to support our projects. Our Protected Species Observer training curriculum was created by NMFS approved PSOs and A.I.S., Inc. scientists, in consultation with BOEM, BSEE, and NMFS staff. Individuals that successfully complete the training and meet the minimum qualifications may be eligible to serve on offshore enterprise projects, compliant with BSEE and NMFS standards.
