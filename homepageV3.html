        <h2>Over twenty-five years of experience monitoring protected species for population assessments as well as mitigation requirements during various levels of marine construction.</h2>
        <p>AIS provides highly qualified scientists on projects include dredging, blasting, pile driving, cable lay, seismic survey operations, natural resource damage assessment and government funded research projects. We employ a large, full time staff of highly experienced National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) and Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) certified Protected Species Observers (PSO) and Passive Acoustic Monitors (PAM). Our team comes equipped with all of the necessary equipment to perform their duties. Additionally, we offer night vision, thermal imaging and infrared technology to supplement monitoring in low visibility conditions.  We continue to follow the technological advancements and software improvements being made in the PAM field.  We are currently working with clients and partners to test emerging technologies that aim to improve our monitoring capability and increase the services we offer to our clients.</p>

        <p>AIS has supported NOAA Fisheries and their regional observer programs since 1999. Our fisheries observers and at-sea monitors work from coastal communities throughout the United States. They deploy on commercial fishing vessels to safely collect and deliver high quality fisheries data and samples to NOAA Fisheries.

            The National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) mission is to understand and predict changes in the Earth’s environment and conserve and manage coastal and marine resources to meet our Nation’s economic, social, and environmental needs. NOAA Fisheries supports the overall NOAA mission by providing science-based conservation and management for sustainable fisheries and aquaculture, marine mammals, endangered species, and their habitats.</p>

        <p>AIS employs a multi-discipline team of technicians and scientists well qualified to design and implement sampling programs in the marine, estuarine and terrestrial environments.  We specialize in managing large field sampling programs with a geographically dispersed work force.    Services have been provided to federal and state agencies as well as private customers for over 25 years.

            By leveraging AIS’s experienced scientific and technical staff  to meet their data collection and sampling capabilities, clients can set up field studies quickly and maintain a sampling schedule optimized for their needs. This eliminates the need to hire and train staff for field work. Our staff are ready when you are and available for projects of any size or duration throughout the United States.

            AIS provides individual technicians and scientists to round out a sampling crew or a team of scientists, technicians, and managers to conduct your sampling regimes. Our staff is available for day, night, weekend and holiday sampling schedules.

            AIS has provided U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (ACoE) certified Dredged Material Inspectors (DMI) for clients operating in the North and mid Atlantic regions of the United States since 1988. DMI services are often a permitting requirement during dredging and marine construction projects.

Dredged Material Inspectors deploy aboard tugs and hopper dredges. They are responsible for monitoring and documenting the placement of dredged material during transit and disposal. In many cases DMIs, who have received NMFS ESO approval, will also monitor for the presence of sensitive marine life. A.I.S. Inspectors are also available to complete compliance monitoring of dredged material for upland disposal.
