                <br>
                <br>
                Commercial fishing dates back hundreds of years. Today, commercial fishing is possible due to cooperation between the fishing industry and fisheries scientists like you. Marine Biologists provide data that allows NOAA to conduct in-season management of fisheries,
                stock assessments, and ecosystem studies. This regional, scientific monitoring supports ten national standards of sustainability required by the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, which helps preserve future generations of fish and fishing communities. Commit to the journey!
